# ML Project 2 Notes

## UNM Learn Instructions

Your task is to implement Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for document classification as specified in your project description. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. This collection has become a popular dataset for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

### Turn in the following:

- 1 pdf file containing your project report
- 1 zip/rar file containing your commented code and README
- A screenshot of your Kaggle entry (user name/team and accuracy)

Submit your file through UNM Learn. The due date is Midnight (+ 3 hrs buffer) contingent to the late policy stated in the syllabus. Your code should contain appropriate comments to facilitate understanding. If needed, your code must contain a Makefile or an executable script that receives the paths to the training and testing files

Your report has to be about 6 to 12 pages long and include:

- A high-level description of how your code works.
- The accuracies you obtain under various settings.
- Explain which options work well and why.
- Contrast both algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy
- Answers to questions 1 to 8

#### Rubric:

- Your code is thoroughly commented (10 pts)
- You provided a well documented README file (10 pts)
- Implementation of Na√Øve Bayes is correct (15 pts)
- Implementation of Logistic Regression is correct (15 pts)
- Your report is clear, concise and well organized (10 pts)
- Your answers to questions 1 to 7 (40 pts)
